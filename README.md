# WeatherForecastOnLocation


This task is to get Weather Data on Google Map (Python + Angular )

Populate weather data using any open weather API. 

This application allows you to search anything on the map and when the pinpoint location is visualizing on map, it should have weather data upon clicking that pin point. 

For example;

If I am searching on the map about Walmart, I will have Walmart location data visualized on the map along with that location's weather details.
